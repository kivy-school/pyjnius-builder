not sure how to deal with next part but i assume we can use this 
* https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser
to parse the java to ast , and then use the export to json feature

then write a command tool in swift that reads the json (codable) and
use https://github.com/Py-Swift/PySwiftAST to write the python code
soo logic needs to be created in convert the java ast to python ast
* https://github.com/Py-Swift/Figma2Kv/tree/master/Sources/KivyCanvasDesigner example of using PySwiftAst

and for writing the python code there is all the simplejnius repos 

and along the way also write tests to confirm our java_ast->py_ast does as expected always...

the cli tool should just have an input arg for what folder to scan, and destination for where to dump the generated files...
